remmina (1.4.6+dfsg-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  The main change with this release is the split of Kiosk support from
  the main 'remmina' package to a separate 'remmina-plugin-kiosk' binary
  package. In case you're using Remmina's Kiosk support on your setup,
  you'd better update the 'remmina' package first and add the relevant
  plugin later, to avoid conflicts with files installed.
